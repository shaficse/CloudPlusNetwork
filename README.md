## Background

Despite the widespread adoption of AWS, there's a gap in practical, hands-on experience among aspiring cloud professionals.

## Problem Statement

A noticeable divide exists between theoretical knowledge of cloud services and the practical ability to implement scalable, secure web applications on AWS.

## Objective

To architect and launch 'CloudPlus Network,' a web-based application utilizing AWS services for authentication, data management, and content delivery. The project aims to provide a practical learning experience in deploying scalable applications using AWS technologies including Cognito, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudFront.

## Project Description

'CloudPlus Network' aims to create an accessible platform where users can seamlessly engage, sharing online spaces for interaction, showcasing the utilization of AWS for:

- Authentication (Cognito)
- Dynamic content delivery (CloudFront)
- Serverless computing (Lambda)
- API management (API Gateway)
- Data storage (DynamoDB and S3)

## Architecture

The project architecture involves a front-end built with modern web technologies, interfacing with backend services hosted on AWS. Key AWS Services include:

- Lambda for application logic
- DynamoDB for managing user data
- Cognito for secure user authentication
- S3 for static web page storage
- CloudFront
- API Gateway

## Well-Architecture Framework

The project aligns with the AWS Well-Architected Framework, covering Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability.

### Operational Excellence

Achieved through automation, monitoring, and iterative processes using AWS Lambda, CloudWatch, and CI/CD methodologies.

### Security

Secured by AWS Cognito for authentication, IAM for access management, and encryption of data in transit and at rest.

### Reliability

Ensured through DynamoDB, stateless Lambda functions, and resilient S3 and CloudFront services.

### Performance Efficiency

Leverages AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, and CloudFront for scalable and efficient performance.

### Cost Optimization

Minimizes costs by adjusting resources to match demand, supplemented by continuous usage monitoring.

### Sustainability

Focuses on efficient use of computing resources and planning future improvements with AWS CloudFormation to automate infrastructure management.

## Development Phases

Outlined are the initial setup, development of Lambda functions, integration of front-end and backend, deployment, and evaluation phases.

## Progress Status

Details the progress of tasks such as Application Front-end, Initial Cloud Setup, Development, Integration, Deployment, and Evaluation with respective durations, hours required, assigned resources, start and end dates, and completion percentages.

## Cost Estimation of AWS Services

Provides a monthly cost estimation of AWS Services, highlighting the utilization within and after the Free Tier limits.
